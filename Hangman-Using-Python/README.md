# Hangman_Game_Using_Python
<p>I have created Hangman Game using Python and it's functions.
I have used most of the basic skills of python : strings, if-else, loop, and list.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
I wanted my project to help the user in playing a delightful game where they have a guess a word by it's alphabets, the word set in the code whih we can change by ourselves and to let the player guess it using alphabets randomly, The moment you'll give worng answer it'll collect their wrong guess to make the man hang and where you are finish with their guesses, they lose the game but if they the wins then Geneuis I must say.
