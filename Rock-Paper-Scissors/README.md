# Kaun-Banega-Crorepati
<p>I have created the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game using Python and it's functions.
I have used most of the basic skills of python : strings, if-else, loop, and list.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
I wanted my project to help the user in playing a delightful game where you have to choose between a rock, paper or scissor what you want to throw at your compatitor, if it's same then it's a tie but if it's rock and scissors then the rock wins, if it's rock and paper then the paper wins, if it's paper and scissors then the scissors wins.
