# Kaun-Banega-Crorepati
<p>I have created the Kaun-Banega-Crorepati Game using Python and it's functions.
I have used most of the basic skills of python : strings, if-else, loop, and list.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
I wanted my project to help the user in playing a delightful game where they'll be asked questions as Amitabh Bachchan does in the television show KBC and then the participant wins a cash prize on every correct answer and along this process they can also use a few helplines.
